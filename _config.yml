# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  摘自《小西天狄道传奇》
  扫地为何？ 为了静地。 静地为何？ 为了静心。 静心为何？ 静心方能见众生。见得了众生，方能勘破生死。生敬天地之心，心无挂碍。无挂而故，无有恐怖。远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。
